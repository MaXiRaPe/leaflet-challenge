# leaflet-challenge
UNCC Data Science Bootcamp - Module 15 Challenge

The object of this challenge was to visualize a map of earthquakes registered by the United Statess Geological Survey (USGS). 
The visualization was created using Leaflet with a GeoJSON dataset file downloaded from the USGS website for the option : 
"All Earthquakes" from the "Past 7 Days" menu.

The magnitude of the earthquakes is reflected by the data markers' size.
The ocurring depth of the earthquakes is reflected by the data markers' color range.
The range/color scale is described by a legend.
Popups are included with the following information:
  a.- Earthquake ocurrence location description
  b.- Earthquake ocurrence data and time
  c.- Earthquake magnitude
  d.- Earthquake ocurrence depth

Resources: 
The leaflet documentation was very helpful and easy to follow in creating the script for this visualization.
The Mozilla MDN Web Docs was very helpful to fill in the gaps and better understanding the syntax.
The Xpert Learning Assistant was very helpful to fill in the gaps and to debug the script.
